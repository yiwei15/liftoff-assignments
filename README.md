## Submission Instructions

### Overview

My project is a web application that will allow the parents to manage their kids’ activities and schedule. It will allow the parents to create parent accounts and restricted kids’ accounts under parental control. Users can add, edit and delete an activity and generate reports based on kid, time, category.

The movitation I had for this application is the need for parents to manage their kids activities. Now we are experiencing a difficult time of covid, children have to stay at home and take multiple short online sessions each day. Each child has his/her own schedule which changes day by day, which makes it very difficult for the parent to manage all the activities. They want an efficient way to manage, view and track their kids’ activites.

### Features

* User Sign up: Users can create parent accounts and children’s sub-accounts. Parent accounts and children accounts have different level accesses. 
* User Login: Users can login accounts by authentication.
* Edit, Create, and Delete Activies: Users can create, edit, delete an event.
* Import External Calendar: Users can import events from external source, such as google calendar.
* View calendar for each child: Users can view each kid’s calendar separately. 
* Create to-do list: Users can generate a to-do list by kid and time. 
* View Activity Report for each child: Users can view each child’s activites by status and time.
* Caculate Screen Time for each child: Users can check each child’s screen time per day or per week.

### Technologies
